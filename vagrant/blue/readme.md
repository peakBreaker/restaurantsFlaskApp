# Blueprint test

This directory is for testing the flask blueprint feature, including:

* Modularizing an application
  * Seperate api module
  * Seperate site module
  * Using helperfunctions
* Rendering templates with common static files and base html
* Common configs
* sqlalchemy and sqlite

In essence this is just some boilerplate code for further development
